## About

#### Overview
[iMSTK](https://www.imstk.org/) is a C++ based free & open-source toolkit that aids rapid prototyping of real-time multi-modal surgical simulation scenarios. [Unity](https://unity.com/) is a multi-platform game engine designed to create 2D and 3D games. You will have received this plugin either via the Unity Asset Store or by cloning the git repository.

While the asset contains all the binaries needed to run the plugin the code in the repository only contains the C# scripts, demo scenarios and resources needed to build imstk Unity package. To run it you will need to build iMSTK. The repository also contains two folders not included in the Asset (`Docs~` and `Tools~`), the `~` character is used to hide these folders from Unity.
